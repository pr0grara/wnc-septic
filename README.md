# Blue Ridge Septic Pros — Lead-Gen Site

A static, config-driven, SEO-first lead-gen website for **septic pumping, repair & inspections
across Western North Carolina**. Built from [`../SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) (the single source of truth)
using Astro 5 — no database, no server runtime, no client framework. Output is plain static
HTML/CSS for a CDN. Built from `../sa-mobile-brake/`.

> **Status:** placeholder business identity (company name, phone `(828) 555-0182`, email, domain)
> + free-licensed placeholder septic photos. It builds clean and is ready to launch once you swap in
> the real business details, real job photos, and a form backend — **do not edit `src/pages`,
> `src/layouts`, `src/components`, or `src/lib` to rebrand.** The answer is almost always in
> `src/config/`.
>
> No reviews, ratings, or licensed/insured claims are asserted — those are intentionally left out
> until they can be confirmed for the real business (see `Footer.astro` placeholder note).
> **No favicon** ships on purpose (see `BaseLayout.astro`); search engines fall back to a generic icon.

## Verified build (Node 22)

- **87 HTML pages** + `robots.txt` + sitemap — matches the SPEC §6 formula:
  - 1 home + 7 service hubs + **66** service×city combos + 11 city hubs + privacy + terms.
- **Lean launch sitemap: 19 URLs** — homepage + 7 service hubs + 11 city hubs only. The 66
  service×city combo pages are `noindex` **and** excluded from the sitemap; legal pages are excluded
  too. (Combos still exist for internal linking / long-tail; they're just kept out of the index.)
- JSON-LD per page type: home → `LocalBusiness + FAQPage`; service hubs → `LocalBusiness +
  Breadcrumb + Service + FAQPage`; combos → localized 3-level breadcrumbs; city hubs → 2-level
  breadcrumb + FAQ.
- Canonicals, `og:`/Twitter tags, `theme-color`, hero `<link rel=preload fetchpriority=high>`,
  **CSS fully inlined** (0 render-blocking stylesheets), self-hosted Inter.
- Call-only form renders an on-page "we'll call you back" acknowledgement (submit disabled), with
  honeypot + validation already wired for when a backend is connected.

## Configuration (current decisions)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Company | *Blue Ridge Septic Pros* (placeholder) |
| Region | Western North Carolina |
| Cities (11) | Asheville, Hendersonville, Waynesville, Black Mountain, Weaverville, Fletcher, Arden, Brevard, Marion, Burnsville, Sylva |
| Services (7) | `septic-services` (hubOnly catch-all) + `septic-tank-pumping`, `septic-tank-cleaning`, `septic-system-repair`, `septic-inspections`, `drain-field-repair`, `emergency-septic-service` (emergency) |
| Matrix services | 6 (→ 66 combo pages, all `noindex` + out of sitemap) |
| Form backend | **Call-only** (`formEndpoint=""`) — wire to Web3Forms / Formspree / a Worker later |
| Phone / email / domain | Placeholders (`(828) 555-0182`, `blueridgesepticpros.com`) — replace before launch |
| Design | Same base as `sa-mobile-brake`, with the accent shifted from glass-blue to a service green (navy bands + green + white) |

## Build & run

The default `node` on this machine is **v15** (too old for Astro 5). Build with **Node 22**:

```bash
nvm use 22          # .nvmrc pins 22; v22.14.0 is installed and builds clean
npm install
npm run dev         # local dev server
npm run check       # astro check (type-check; astro build does NOT type-check)
npm run build       # static output → dist/
npm run preview     # preview the built site
npm run deploy      # astro build && npx wrangler deploy (Cloudflare Workers Static Assets)
```

`SITE_URL` overrides the production domain at build/deploy time (the only env var read).

---

## Where to edit for a rebrand (config-only)

1. **[`src/config/site.ts`](src/config/site.ts)** — drives most titles, descriptions, headings, and
   schema. **Replace the placeholders:** `company`, `phone` / `phoneDisplay`, `email`, `url`. Comments
   show where to wire the lead form (`formEndpoint` + `formAccessKey`).
2. **[`src/config/services.ts`](src/config/services.ts)** — the services offered (keep ~1 `hubOnly`).
3. **[`src/config/cities.ts`](src/config/cities.ts)** — the areas served, with genuinely local copy.
   `nearby` slugs must reference existing cities.
4. **Assets** — see [`src/assets/README.md`](src/assets/README.md). Keep `astro.config.mjs` `site`,
   `wrangler.jsonc` `name`, and `package.json` `name` in sync.

A handful of trade-specific strings live in `src/pages/index.astro` and a few components (the
homepage intro/urgency sections, `ServiceAreaMap.astro` `COUNTIES`) — already written for septic in
Western North Carolina.

## ⚠️ Before launch

1. **Replace placeholder business details** in `src/config/site.ts` (real company, phone, email,
   domain) — and keep `astro.config.mjs` `site` in sync.
2. **Swap the placeholder septic photos** for real local job photos (your truck, a tank being pumped
   on a mountain lot, your crew on a WNC property). The current images are free-licensed Wikimedia
   Commons stand-ins; real local proof is load-bearing for this kind of site (SPEC §2). See
   [`src/assets/README.md`](src/assets/README.md).
3. **Only add `ratingValue` / `reviewCount`** in `site.ts` once you have real, verifiable reviews
   (fake counts are a "scammy" signal and break schema validation).
4. **Connect the lead form** by setting `formEndpoint` (Web3Forms / Formspree / a Cloudflare Worker).
